Description: Set of facilities to extend Python3 with C++
 PyCXX is a set of C++ facilities to make it easier to write Python3
 extensions. The main advantage is that it greatly increases the
 probability that your program will not make a reference-counting
 errors and will not have to continually check error returns from
 the Python C API.
 .
 This package contains the Python3 headers and sources.
